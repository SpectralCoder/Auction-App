## ISSUES
##### While sending files using form it is required to have 'enctype="multipart/form-data"' in form attribute in django template.
##### Media urls should be set for showing static images.
##### For foreign key query in models, objects are needed not just a value. 
##### Changing admin template is kinda scary, enlighten me ðŸ©¹
##### Static images aren't rendered in heroku.
